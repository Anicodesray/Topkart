# Topkart
Hi I have made th assignment for the junior role
Assignment for the junior role:

Context:

A global E-commerce website named Topkart uses an API to handle lightning deals. Lightning deals are products that are available at a discounted price on the website for a brief amount of time. The expiry time of a lightning deal is not more than 12 hours. These will be refreshed at 00:00 UTC daily. The functionality of Topkart API:

Admin actions 

Create and update lightning deals

Approve orders

Customer actions

Access available unexpired deals

Place orders 

Check the status of their order


A lightning deal contains the following data points:

Product Name

Actual & Final price

Total & Available units

Expiry Time


Requirement:

Build an API to handle Topkartâ€™s lightning deals.



Considerations:

Users should not be able to place an order for a deal that is expired
